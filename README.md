## Getting Started

This script helps you quickly set up a Vite project for React by simplifying the initialization process.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed.
- Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed and available from the command line.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh

    ```

2. Move the `reactVite` script to `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```sh
